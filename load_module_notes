1. type a string to explain the module and its arguments
-- done in the ui
2. parse the string to break the arg string into tl_args 
3. install it into a class
-- done with tl_class_setup
4. use dlopen to grab the module intit function 
-- this takes the class (which already has the parsed argument vector) as its sole argument 
-- the class then gets the dsp and kill functions installed as well as the appropriately initialized module structure -- this lives a void * inside the class structure, but is recast appropriately by the dsp and kill functions
